# Pinz

Pinz is to become a real time event application for UCF's campus. Users will be able to find and create events around them.

## Local Setup

Follow [Facebook's getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for setting up React Native for iOS and Android on your machine.

Once React Native is installed, you will need to clone the project and install dependencies with `npm install` while inside the root directory.

Follow [Airbnb's guide for setting up react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) properly on your machine. Pinz uses Google Maps, so you will need to get an API key and **make sure your iOS setup is not using Apple maps.**

Setting this up is a pain in the ass, but if you can work your way through the guides you should be good to go. If you're having trouble, don't be afraid to search through issues on [react-native-maps' repo](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/issues).
